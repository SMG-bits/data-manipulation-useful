1. csv_to_json_converter.py
- simple CSV to JSON converter that can be runed in any VS Code enviroment. Uses Python3 and in some cases required Pandas for CSV separated by "|".
- safe and easy to use, tested with about 450k lines
- run directly in VS Code, it will ask you to select the source file and commit in the JSON file in the same directory, pretty fast.
